# **Conclusion**

# Establish more of supermarket Type one

## to increase item outlet sales, we should be focusing on creating more establishments that represent supermarket typ1 more, and further more inspect how super market 1 looks and is presenting its items and apply it to other supermarket types, the item type wouldnt have an effect on the total sales since its based on the necessities of the consumer, we can make sure to present items in a supermarket 1 type manner to insure visibility and probability of sales increase.

### Business problem:

Increase item outlet sales

### Data:
[Data](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/)

## Methods
- I've used basic methods to manually observe, clean, and fix inconsistencies
- then i went to visualize my cleaned data to get a better feel of the data. and a bigger picture of the data
- you can find my attempted models to try to use the current available features to manufacture a model to predict our item outlet sales
- my reccomendation to create an interface for other supermarket types that is similar to supermarket type one, is based on the need to aquire more data about consumer behaviour and to further inspect the connection of location and size to the item outlet sales, we are moving forward to make a several visits to the establishments and try to get more features that i might think would be correlated to item outlet sales that were not included in our data, such might be the uniform of employees, their attitude, their age and experience, our discount mechanism and decoration\presentation of every section.
- you can find the current modeled tune in my notebook, and see further information about the model in the next paragraph.

## Results

# Prediction-of-Product-Sales
##### you can find the procedure taken to clean the data and make sure that everything is in line with how we want the datafram to looklike, we named the data frame df for reference, showing every aspect of the data we inspected along the process

***following you can find graphs that explore the data we have been provided, i will be briefly addressing a couple of the graphs which will be seen in this read me next,  more analysis available within the repository***

> from exploring the previous graphs we can tell that the type 3 supermarket has the most sales, along side the supermarket type 1, also  we can see that the outlets establishment year had immaterial effect on the item outlet sales.


## Model: Random Forest Prediction Model
- i would not recommend using this model yet! 'this is further explained in **methods** paragraph

 > Model Results for mathematicians

##  This model we are presenting here, is the premium model we have for predicting the item outlet sales, it performs with an accuracy of 60.3% which is represented by a miss prediction of around $728; we can start using this model, but we will have to take more time to be able to guarentee a better more accurate model for estimating our future item outlet sales based on our feature and attend our business to inspect for more features and categories that might be a better indicator, which we call permutation importance feature, meanwhile our next goal is to take the time to remodel our process to aim atleast for 80% accuracy of prediction to be confident of our future predictions

- Overall, the best model is definitely the tuned Random Forest Regressor Model. by far it outperformed the linear regression model.



## Recommendations Limitations & Next Steps:

 my reccomendation to create an interface for other supermarket types that is similar to supermarket type one, is based on the need to aquire more data about consumer behaviour and to further inspect the connection of location and size to the item outlet sales, we are moving forward to make a several visits to the establishments and try to get more features that i might think would be correlated to item outlet sales that were not included in our data, such might be the uniform of employees, their attitude, their age and experience, our discount mechanism and decoration\presentation of every section.
